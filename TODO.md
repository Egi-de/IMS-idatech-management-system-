# TODO: Fix Theme Toggle Double-Click Issue

## Tasks

- [x] Edit `client/src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` to make `isDark` a reactive state that updates correctly when theme changes, preventing the need for double-clicks to toggle between dark and light modes.

## Followup Steps

- [x] Test the theme toggle in the app to confirm it works with a single click.
- [x] Verify that components using `isDark` update correctly.
